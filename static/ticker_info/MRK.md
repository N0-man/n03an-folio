# Merck (MRK)

Merck is a global pharmaceutical company that generates revenue through several key business segments:

**Pharmaceutical Products:**

- Oncology (KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, Lenvima, WELIREG)
- Vaccines (GARDASIL, VAXNEUVANCE, CAPVAXIVE)
- Cardiovascular (WINREVAIR)
- Hospital Acute Care
- Other prescription medications

**Animal Health:**

- Companion animal products
- Livestock products
- Aquaculture products (recently expanded through Elanco acquisition)

Despite some near-term challenges with GARDASIL in China, Merck continues to demonstrate strong fundamental performance and execution:

- The core pharmaceutical business remains robust with KEYTRUDA continuing to drive growth and expand into new indications
- Successfully launching WINREVAIR with strong initial uptake and reimbursement coverage
- Pipeline diversification efforts showing results with tripled Phase 3 assets and multiple promising candidates
- A strong balance sheet allows continued investment in R&D and strategic acquisitions
- Management provided clarity on China GARDASIL expectations ($2-3B annual opportunity over the next several years)
  The company's focus on innovative medicines and vaccines, strong commercial execution, and robust pipeline position it well for sustainable long-term growth. While GARDASIL faces near-term headwinds in China, the global opportunity remains substantial with less than 10% of the eligible population vaccinated worldwide.
