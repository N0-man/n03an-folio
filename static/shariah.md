# ⭕️ 01 Purifying Intentions

**إِنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ، وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى، فَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ فَهِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ، وَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ لِدُنْيَا يُصِيبُهَا أَوِ امْرَأَةٍ يَنْكِحُهَا فَهِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى مَا هَاجَرَ إِلَيْهِ.**

"Actions are judged by intentions, so each person will have what they intended. Whoever migrates with an intention for Allah and His Messenger, the migration will be for the sake of Allah and His Messenger. And whoever migrates for worldly gain or to marry a woman, then his migration will be for the sake of whatever he migrated for."
_(Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 1; Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1907)_

This good can be as simple as taking care of your own family.

قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم
_"إذا أنفق المسلم نفقة على أهله وهو يحتسبها كانت له صدقة."\*\*(صحيح البخاري، حديث 5351؛ صحيح مسلم، حديث 1002)_

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:
_"When a Muslim spends on his family, seeking reward for it from Allah, it is counted as charity for him."\*\*(Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 5351; Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1002)_

or making sure your family are supported after you pass away...

قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم:
_"إنك إن تذر ورثتك أغنياء خير من أن تذرهم عالة يتكففون الناس."\*\*(صحيح البخاري، حديث 2742؛ صحيح مسلم، حديث 1628)_

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:
_"It is better for you to leave your heirs wealthy than to leave them poor, begging from others.(Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 2742; Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1628)_

Importantly, when we purify our intentions we gain a robust ethical framework for making difficult decisions.

If our core motivation for investing is to please Allah ﷻ, then it hardly makes any sense to do something displeasing to Allah ﷻ in pursuit of this goal.
So, before embarking on your investment journey, ensure it is worthwhile by taking a moment to sincerely dedicate your efforts to the pleasure of Allah ﷻ. Your future self will be glad you did.

## Planning

Do you want to buy a house? Retire? Save for your children’s education?
_Use the S.M.A.R.T. framework to articulate your goals._
This means making sure your financial goals are:

- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**chievable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime-Bound

An example of a well-written goal is:

To accumulate $10 million in halal investments within 10 years, enabling a comfortable retirement by August 2033.

## Starting with a Lead

Historical data shows that the stock market goes through cycles of correction, on average experiencing a 10% decline every 11 months, a 20% drop every four years, and plummeting more than 30% at least once per decade.

However, on average the market is moving upwards 70% of the time.

Meaning if you stay invested long enough, you’ll almost always end up ahead.

in order to make sure you have the biggest investing advantage which is a large time horizon, make sure you’ve done the following:

1. Earn more than you spend
2. Set aside an emergency fund
3. Pay off your interest-bearing debt
4. Set aside savings for imminent expenses

# ⭕️ 02 Demystifying Stocks

## What Are Stocks?

On a fundamental level stocks are fractional ownership shares in actual businesses. Hence units of stock are called “shares”.
The terms “stocks” and “equities” are often used interchangeably in the financial world. Here’s why:
In a broad financial sense, equity refers to an ownership interest in an asset. If you own a house, your equity in the house is the current market value of the house minus any mortgage or other debts against it. Essentially, it’s what you’d have left if you sold the house and paid off the debts.
For example, if the market value of your house is $1 million and you owe $400,000 against your house, your equity in the house is $600,000.
It’s the same with corporations where:
_Equity = Total Assets − Total Liabilities_
When you buy stocks, you are buying part of the company’s Stockholder Equity - a claim on part of the company’s residual assets and earnings.

## What makes stocks a particularly appealing investment?

### 1. Multi-X Returns Are Plausible

If you invested in Microsoft 30 years ago, you would be up more than 2,500 times today. This means an investment of just $10,000 would be worth $25 million today.
The potential to risk X and earn 10X, 100X, and sometimes even 1000X is a very appealing dynamic that is seldom even plausible with other assets. Real estate, commodities, and bonds rarely display similar promise.
\*Side note, bonds are interest-bearing debt, don’t just avoid them because of their poor returns; they’re also haram.
It only takes identifying 1 future Microsoft in your lifetime to become incredibly wealthy.
This is not to say that you have to risk your entire investment in one position to achieve fantastic results.

### 2. Public Disclosures Are Required

Publicly traded companies are subject to strict regulations by entities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States and similar entities in other countries.
These companies are required to regularly disclose financial statements, annual reports (10-K), quarterly reports (10-Q), and other material information designed to keep investors informed about the company’s performance.
Investors are seldom privy to these regular, reliably audited disclosures when investing in private companies.

### 3. Inflation Protection

$1 today buys less than it did one year ago, and in all likelihood, buys more today than it will one year from now. This is known as "inflation".
The purchasing power of your money is like a melting icecube when its sitting idly uninvested. Investing in stocks offers a way to counteract this "melting" effect. Historically, the stock market has provided returns that outpace inflation, allowing your invested dollars to grow faster than they lose value.
For example, the long-term inflation rate of the U.S. dollar has averaged 3.1% annually since 1913.
On the other hand, stocks have averaged double-digit average annual returns during this same period.
So compared to just saving money, investing in stocks not only protects your purchasing power but grows it as well.

### 4. High Liquidity

Liquidity refers to the speed with which you can convert an investment into cash. 
It doesn’t get more liquid than pulling out your phone and selling a stock position in a matter of seconds.
This is a challenge for other assets like real estate and private equity where it can sometimes take years to cash out of a position. Consequently, your invested money may not be accessible when you need it.

### 5. Easy Diversification

Diversification refers to spreading your investment money over various investments to reduce the impact of any one position losing a lot of value.
Many investors fail to recognize the significant diversification potential that stock investing offers.
For example, owning five properties in a single city might seem diversified, but in reality, it’s exposed to localized economic risks. If the property market in this city suffers, all 5 properties may suffer at the same time. On the other hand, with stocks, you can buy five different companies belonging to five different industries that are based in 5 different regions of the world in a matter of minutes.
So to summarize, attributes that make stocks an attractive investment include:

1. Multi-X Returns Are Plausible
2. Public Disclosures Are Required
3. Inflation Protection
4. High Liquidity
5. Easy Diversification

## Are Stocks Halal?

As we learned, stocks are fractional ownership shares in actual businesses.
There is nothing controversial in Islam about buying shares in actual businesses regardless of whether these shares are traded on public markets or not. So we can comfortably say that, in principle, investing in shares of businesses (“stocks”) is not haram.Logically, there are instances when owning shares of a business can be haram and these instances broadly include when the company:
1 Earns money from haram.
2 Relies on haram in order to operate. Most commonly this will manifest in a reliance on interest-bearing debt.
3 Engages in or is expected to engage in unethical behavior.

⠀We don’t want to be a part owner in a company where any of the aforementioned applies. This is because companies sell stock to raise money. This money is then used for the development and growth of the company or as a way for company owners to cash out their ownership positions. So we don’t want to enable any expansion of non-Islamic activities or reward its practitioners.Even after their initial sale, companies still benefit and care about their stock price for a number of reasons including:
1 Stockholders appoint the board of directors, who in turn select a company’s management team. Therefore, the shareholders are the de facto bosses of the management. In order for management to keep their stockholder bosses happy, they have to ensure the stock price is going up over time. 
2 Company leadership often owns a lot of stock and is paid in stocks or options to buy the stock.

If a company’s stock price grows, lenders assign a lower risk profile to the company and offer it lower interest rates when it needs funding.So even after their initial sale, the company and its management still have a vested interest in ensuring their stock price is constantly growing. Therefore, by buying a company’s stock and supporting its price stockholders are enabling and rewarding the company’s business and its management’s behavior. Accordingly, the halal-conscious investor should be careful to not do this, let alone profit from it.

_Are any companies perfect from an Islamic perspective?_
No.

All companies will have some level of interaction with elements deemed forbidden in Islam, especially publicly traded companies that are of a larger size and have a wider variety of dealings than say your neighborhood convenience store.

At a minimum, all companies keep their money in banks that deal with interest.

Consequently, if we adopt a zero-tolerance policy for anything less than perfect, no companies would be investable for Muslims. This doesn’t seem like an outcome that is in service of the greater well-being of Muslims at large.

Therefore, some amount of judgment is required when deciding on the level of forbidden dealings a company can have before we are uncomfortable investing in it from a halal perspective.

There are now some generally accepted industry standards with regard to screening for Sharia compliance which we cover later in more detail along with the system that I use for screening but ultimately, Sharia screening companies come down to a judgment call.

Keep in mind, **the amount of impermissible activities we target for ourselves should always be zero**. However, when dealing with things that are outside of our control, setting a zero target is impractical.As an analogy, when you work for a company you may know that the company is involved in some haram dealings that are beyond your control. At a minimum, your employer is keeping their cash in an interest-bearing bank account. Cash which they use to pay employees like yourself. By dedicating 8 hours of work per day to your company you are having a far greater impact on the company than simply holding on to its shares.

Yet there is some amount of tolerance for impermissible activity by the employer and for good reason, without it Muslims wouldn’t be able to work for almost any company.Which companies have a degree of haram dealings that makes them intolerable to work for is ultimately a judgment call that every Muslim has to make. Likewise, which companies are tolerable to invest in requires a similar judgment call.

_Moreover, what is the alternative?_

Keeping your purchasing power in cash??The fiat currencies we use today are created through interest-bearing debt. At least shares of a company are created as part of a value-producing enterprise. So there is an argument to be made that keeping your money in stocks is more Sharia-compliant than keeping your money in the fiat currencies which are themselves debt instruments.

So while no company is perfect, I don't think it's practical, or in the Ummah's best interest to declare any imperfection regardless of how small a deal-breaker for investing in any company. Judgment must be exercised.The aim of this course is to empower you to make these ethical judgments on your own in an informed manner.

## Fiat Economy

The dollar, which is the global reserve currency, can only be created by issuing debt, and in order to make this debt profitable, it needs to be tied with interest.

This leads to everyone participating in the economy. Some would pay interest (who borrows money), and some make money (by keeping money in the banks). Basically when you hold money in banks, you are subsidizing everyone else's loans. You enable the banks to issue more loans through your money, and you enable the bank and its customers to earn more interest. Additionally they would invest in prohibited sectors to increase the value of fiat…

Even if you hold your money inside or outside the banks, In fiat world ($ or Rs) where debt is money, everyone pays for it through the loss of purchasing power. This is called as inflation e.g what you could buy today for Rs 1000 would be way more than 10 years from now (people call this as “mehangai bad gai hai” but this is called as inflation and it’s tied to riba)…

# ⭕️ 04 Sharia Compliance - PIF

## Criteria for Sharia -Compliance

### Nature of Business

A company is non-compliant if its primary business involves Haram (forbidden) products or services.
For instance, businesses in porn, gambling, alcohol, or banking are classified as Haram.
The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) has proposed a threshold of 5% to distinguish between material and trivial non-compliant revenues.
Put differently, in order for a company to be considered for investment, the following should be true:
Revenue From Haram / Total Revenue < 5%.
I’m not too fond of this 5% limit, here’s a better one: 2.5%

### Why 2.5% makes more sense than 5%?

I've long questioned the 5% haram revenue threshold in Sharia stock screening, as it has no basis in the Quran or Sunnah.

A 0% threshold is not practical. As mentioned earlier, at the very least, all companies keep their money in bank accounts which helps the bank offer interest-bearing products.

After diving into the study of Zakat I've reconsidered.
Zakat, mandated at 2.5%, exists to cleanse our wealth from impurities.
Allah swt says: "Take, [O, Muhammad], from their wealth a charity by which you purify them".

Specifying 2.5% as the Zakat requirement suggests Muslims shouldn’t normally have more than this that requires purification.

Therefore, doesn’t it make sense to use this percentage when screening stocks for Sharia compliance?

I think it does.

So, at PIF we’ve moved from 5% to a 2.5% threshold for haram revenue.

This way our criterion has a solid basis in Sunnah.
In other words, the criterion we use to check if we’re comfortable investing in a company from a Sharia perspective are:

Revenue From Haram / Total Revenue < 2.5%.

## When Applying This Rule Doesn’t Make Sense:

Exceptions exist where such a criterion may not make sense such as if the company is in the startup phase or the nature of its business is cyclical and includes periods of abnormally low revenues.
For example, Vir Biotechnology (VIR) is a company with more than 10 different treatments that are in various stages of development as of writing this.

![alt text](vir.png)

Since the bulk of its projects are not yet approved (pre-revenue) and the one treatment that it has approved (a COVID treatment) is no longer experiencing the same demand, its revenue is abnormally low compared to the previous few years. In the first quarter of 2023, it had only $63 million in revenue compared to $1.2 billion during the same period of 2022.

Since the company has $2.25 billion in cash, it is earning substantial interest income, around $21 million per quarter. If we apply the rule, “Revenue from Haram/Total Revenue < 5%,” assuming we include “Interest Income” in “Revenue from Haram”, then VIR would fail this test miserably: Revenue From Haram / Total Revenue = $21 million / $60 million = 35% > 2.5%.
However, is it true that this company is materially involved in haram?
As a percentage of cash, the interest income it earns is; $21 million / $2.25 billion < 1%.

So is the Interest Income that the company earns material to the company?
I think the answer is no.

Therefore, when a company is in a startup phase, is pre-revenue, or is in a cyclical industry with extended periods of low revenue, it doesn't make sense to apply the 2.5% rule.

It is therefore essential to understand the phase the company is in and apply your best judgment based on this understanding, remembering the original question that we are trying to answer,
_“Is the company materially involved in haram?”_

### Financial Management

The second consideration attempts to answer the question, “Does the business rely on Riba (interest-bearing debt) in a material way?”
Numerous standards have been proposed for this screen including:

- Debt-to-Assets < 30%
- Debt-to-Equity < 30%
- Debt-to-Market-Capitalization < 30%
  🔴 **All of these are wrong.** 🔴

This is because they focus on the amount of debt a company has, which is not haram, instead of *the interest on this debt* which is.

- It is possible for a company to have a lot of debt and very little interest charged on this debt.
- On the other hand, a company may have comparatively little debt but a lot of interest, if the interest on its debt is high.

To really put a bow on this point, consider the case of a startup that borrowed money from non-interest-bearing sources like friends or family.

According to the debt-to-X standards, this startup would be categorized as not Sharia-compliant since the only thing it has on its books is the cash and the debt it received from the loans it took out. Yet, the company hasn’t done anything wrong; it doesn’t pay any interest on its debt.

This is why I'm advocating for a standard that focuses on the proportion of interest that a company is paying, rather than the amount of debt. This way, a company with debt but a 0% interest rate on this debt can be seen as permissible to invest in.

The standard I’m proposing checks for the following to be true:

**Interest Expense / Total Expense < 2.5%**

This formula focuses on interest instead of debt, acknowledging that debt itself is not prohibited in Islam, but the interest on debt is. If the company passes this test, I consider the company's reliance on interest to not be material i.e. trivial.

It's my belief that this new standard of assessment will be increasingly adopted by others over time, leading to more accurate Sharia-compliant assessments of companies.

### Ethical and Moral Considerations

This consideration focuses on the company's:

- Environmental impact
- Treatment of employees, suppliers, and customers
- Engagement in any questionable dealings with shady actors

There is no formula for this criteria but passing it requires an understanding of the company's impact on everything it comes into contact with. Therefore, the investor must weigh the positive aspects of a company against the negative aspects. I like to use a T-Chart like the one below to make these comparisons:

![alt text](comimpact.png)

Investors should stay away from companies where the harm clearly outweighs the good. If the company's impact is ambiguous, it is advisable to refrain from investing until further information is available.

### Sharia Compliance Ratings

Regardless of the result of your analysis, I propose using “Comfortable”, “Questionable” or “Uncomfortable” to categorize your findings.

- Comfortable is the default.
- Uncomfortable would be appropriate for a company that fails any of the previously mentioned checks. E.g. Revenue greater than 2.5%, Interest Expense greater than 2.5%, or a net negative impact.
- Questionable would be appropriate for a company that failed one of the Revenue or Reliance on interest criteria but we weren’t sure if applying these criteria made sense in the particular company’s situation, or a company with a net impact that wasn't definitively positive or negative.

I would mostly avoid using the words “Halal” and “Haram” to categorize the results of our screenings since Allah SWT is the only authority that can determine halal and haram. Although for obvious cases like a beer company, I would just call it Haram.

For most companies, without specific revelation, the best we can do is attempt to make a best-faith estimate of what Allah’s decree would be, based on the information we have available to us at the time but we can never know for sure.

So let’s bake this understanding of our limitations in the ratings we give by avoiding halal and haram and using the Comfortable, Questionable, and Uncomfortable ratings instead.

### Summary

- The three key screens to assess the Sharia compliance of a company are:
  - Screening for the Source of Revenue: An assessment of the company's source of revenue, where non-compliant revenue should not exceed 2.5% of the total revenue.
  - Screening for Reliance on Interest: Evaluating a company's dependence on interest, where the ratio of interest expense to total operating expense should be less than 2.5%.
  - Screening for Net Impact: Weighing the societal benefits and potential harm that a company brings to society.
- Use “Comfortable”, “Uncomfortable” and “Questionable” to rate the results of your stock screening assessments.

# ⭕️ 05 Finding Great Stocks

## Start reading about the company

Read everything you possibly can about the company.
Let’s say you want to analyze Enphase.  I would start by looking at the following sources:

- [Review the company's halal report on Practical Islamic Finance](https://app.practicalislamicfinance.com/dashboard/stocks/ENPH/)
- [Review the company’s investor presentation](https://investor.enphase.com/static-files/7a95029a-a55b-4f1a-8fe1-5b3c41fef946?v=july-2023)
- [Review diverse opinions on Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENPH)

After you’ve devoted 2-3 hours reading about the company:
Are you comfortable with it from a halal perspective?
Does it still look promising from an investment perspective?
If your answers are yes and yes, roll up your sleeves because it's time to do a deep dive.

## Investment case

### 1. How do they make money?

Do you fully understand the company’s business model?
The way to tell if you have a deep understanding of a company’s business model is to ask yourself: can I explain it to a 10-year-old?
If it’s too complicated, stay away.
You’ll do much better for yourself if you make it a policy to only invest in things you deeply understand.

### 2. Management and incentive structures

A company’s management can be a company’s most important asset and sometimes its greatest liability.
Best sure to check out the track record of current management.
Just as important as management’s capability are their incentives.
Management incentives should be tied to the share price in order to align with shareholder incentives. 
This can be achieved in different ways.
For example, management can own substantial stock in the company. 
This is a good sign. It means management will be rewarded directly for actions that maximize shareholder value.
The absence of it can be a bad sign.
After all, if management doesn’t want to own it, why do you?
Another way management incentives can be aligned with shareholders is if their compensation is associated with the share price.
Either through options or some other mechanism.
This is a less optimal setup compared to management owning a material part of the company since share price-based compensation tends to make management near-term focused.
They become less worried about how the company is going to thrive 5 years from now and more focused on how they can push the share price up next quarter.
They start thinking tactically rather than strategically.  
That said, it remains better than having management incentives completely divorced from shareholder incentives.
I once invested in a company where I discovered later that management was compensated based on production capacity growth. 
So what did they do? 
They diluted the heck out of shareholders, selling more and more shares, in order to raise money to increase their mining capacity. 
Luckily, I sold before the bulk of dilution commenced.
Often you can see how management is being compensated by reading a proxy filing called the DEF 14A.

### 3. Moat

In the context of investing, a moat refers to a durable competitive advantage.
You want companies that are hard to duplicate or compete with.
_“A good business is like a strong castle with a deep moat around it. I want sharks in the moat. I want it untouchable.“ – Warren Buffett_
Moats can come from a variety of different sources,

- **Switching Costs**

⠀Companies like Apple have created high switching costs, both monetary and non-monetary.
Once you’re a customer of one of their products/services, they quickly try to deepen your attachment to them with other products/services.
The goal, in addition to the added revenue, is to make switching away from them extremely expensive in terms of both time and effort required.
This large switching expense is a moat that Apple enjoys and makes the job of competitors who may attempt to poach their customers a very difficult one.
Due to their strong moat, Apple just needs to sell you once, and if they do, they have you for life. This is a good business.

- **Branding**

⠀If you see two sodas side-by-side, advertising the same flavor, one of them is Coca-Cola and the other one isn’t, which one are you choosing?  Many people including myself will opt for Coca-Cola.
It’s a strong brand, with a strong reputation, built over many decades.
Even with substantial investments, competitors have failed to challenge or weaken it.
Coca-Cola’s brand is a moat that protects its business.

- **Network Effects**

⠀Network Effects refer to the value of a product or service increases the more people use it.
This type of moat is most evident in social media companies like Facebook and Twitter.
Every new customer increases the product's value, making it more attractive to potential users and harder to compete with.

- **Cost Advantages**

⠀Companies like Ikea and Walmart can produce goods or services at lower costs than their competitors, providing them with a competitive edge.
This is perhaps my least favorite moat since it often means slimmer profit margins with time.
I much prefer investing in a product that is selling because of its differentiation over one that is selling because it’s good enough and cheaper.

- **Data and Technology Flywheel**

⠀As a company amasses more data to refine its algorithms, for e.g., Google collects more data on user searches, it enters into a virtuous cycle: more data enhances the product’s algorithms, making the product more effective, which in turn attracts more users, providing Google with even more data to improve the product and on and on.  I suspect this type of moat will play a larger role in future companies.
While it’s advantageous for companies to have a moat, in today’s world of rapidly advancing technology, companies that rely too heavily on them and not enough on innovation are vulnerable. 
A case in point is Google's sudden drop in popularity after ChatGPT was introduced.

### 4. Profitability

To fully understand a company’s profitability, we need to analyze its Income Statement.
For more on How to Analyze an Income Statement see the chapter “How to analyze an Income Statement”.
Two fundamental metrics to evaluate a company's profitability are Gross Margin and Net Profit Margin.
**Gross margin** is calculated by taking the difference between a company's Revenue and its Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and then dividing it by the Revenue. 
Here's the formula:
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
A high gross margin is generally a positive sign, indicating that a company retains a good portion of revenue as profit after accounting for the direct costs to produce its goods or services. 
For instance, a gross margin of 40% signifies that a company incurs 60 cents in direct costs to create a product it sells for one dollar, resulting in a 40-cent profit on each dollar of sales.
This is a good gauge of whether or not the company’s business is even viable. 
If the Gross margin is slim or negative, no amount of operational efficiency can fix this. A fundamental change needs to happen.
**Net Profit Margin** factors in all other expenses, not just the cost of producing the goods or services. This includes operating expenses, interest, and taxes. It's calculated using the following formula:
Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue
The net profit margin provides a more comprehensive picture of a company's profitability since it accounts for all costs involved in running the business. Similar to Gross Margin, the higher the net profit margin, the better.
For instance, if a company has a net profit margin of 25%, this means it retains 25 cents as profit from every dollar of revenue, after accounting for all expenses. 
The ability to generate a high Net Income relative to revenue points can signify efficient operations and good management.

### 5. Cash Flow

Cash is the lifeblood of any business.
A business can survive without profits but it can’t survive without cash.
This is why in addition to profitability, you must understand a company’s Cash Flow in order to build a complete business case.
To fully understand a company’s Cash Flow, you need to analyze it’s Statement of Cash Flows.
For more on How to Analyze a Statement of Cash Flows see the chapter “How to analyze a Statement of Cash Flows”.
A fundamental metric to use to gauge a business’s cash flow is the Free Cash Flow Margin (FCF Margin): 
_Free Cash Flow Margin = Free Cash Flow / Revenue_
**The Free Cash Flow Margin shows the percentage of sales which are translated into pure cash for the company.** 
E.g. A FCF margin of 25% means for every $100 the company sells, $25 of cash is generated.

### 6. Debt Burden

As a competent and methodical halal investor, you must gauge the level of risk of anything you put your money into before you make an investment decision.
The level of risk in an investment is directly linked to a company's debt level for several reasons:
1 High debt can strain financial resources, limiting cash available for business development or unexpected costs.
2 Companies with substantial debt are vulnerable to rising interest rates, which increase their interest payments and may affect their permissibility from a halal perspective.
3 Excessive debt elevates the risk of bankruptcy if the company cannot meet its debt payments.

⠀To understand a company’s debt burden, the investor must analyze its Balance Sheet. 
For more on how to analyze a Balance Sheet see the chapter “How to analyze a Balance Sheet”.
A fundamental ratio to determine the level of a company’s debt burden is**:**
Net Debt / Free Cash Flow
**Net Debt** refers to the total debt of a company after subtracting its available cash and cash equivalents. It's a measure of a company's financial obligations that aren't offset by liquid assets.
**Free Cash Flow (FCF)** represents the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. Essentially, it's the cash available for expansion, dividends, debt repayment, or other discretionary uses.
**The Net Debt / Free Cash Flow** shows you how many years it would take a company to pay down all its debt if it were to use all available free cash flow. 
Ideally, you want this number to be lower than 2.

### 7. Outlook

Fundamentally, investing is a forward-looking activity. 
One common pitfall for investors is focusing too much on the rearview mirror and not enough on the road ahead.
When investing, it’s essential to identify businesses that are active participants in what you assess to be long-term, sustainable trends.
Trends that are top of mind for me and fit this bill include renewable energy, artificial intelligence, aging populations, cybersecurity, obesity management, and robotics.
These are trends belonging to expanding markets, providing companies in the space with long runways for robust growth.

### 8. Valuation

Identifying a wonderful business isn’t enough. 
You have to be sure not to overpay. 
That said, if the identified wonderful business has a long enough growth runway, it becomes very hard to overpay.
This is because substantial future earnings growth can offset a higher initial purchase price, resulting in considerable long-term returns.
For example, if you paid $20 for Tesla shares when they first went public in 2010 and were trading for $1.28 you would have overpaid by a lot.
However, if you held on for a decade your $20 would still have multiplied more than 15 times.
The point is, don’t nickel and dime the great ones.
That said, few companies are like Tesla.
When dealing with companies that aren’t once-in-a-generation, game-changers like Tesla, valuation plays a more important role.
Quality investors look for wonderful businesses at a fair price. 
Not necessarily a discount, but fair.
Since valuation is a rather important topic, we’ve dedicated a later chapter to it.
